# rainyware XMB portal
after making a portal site with this to link to games and stuff cuz our school blocks too much stuff, i realized this may actually have some decent uses outside of that so i'm open-sourcing the v1 portal.

it also looks like the PS3 and PSP home screen (may have borrowed that idea)

here's an example of what you could do with this project:
<img width="1881" height="932" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/313c2c39-2c63-430a-b768-af17e75eda13" />

# capabilities
listed below are some capabilities that this project provides
- add any URLs to websites
- make them open in about:blank page (rarely needed outside of the portal's original environment)
- display a description for each item in the bottom right corner
- easy to organize into different categories like the PS3 or PSP's home menu is

the version in releases requires any web server no matter how basic it is so long as it serves all the files, it comes with some PS3 style icons and a placeholder icon included.

# setting up
just extract the zip and serve the files in it over HTTP or HTTPS. when you go to the site for the first time, a link to the setup guide is in category 1. if you can't access it from there you can find the guide [here](https://files.rainsounds2.com/public_files/portal-guide.pdf)
